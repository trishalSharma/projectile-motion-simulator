# projectile-motion-simulator
A web-based Projectile Motion Simulator that visually demonstrates the physics of projectile motion using real-time animations and user-controlled parameters. This project helps learners understand how variables like initial velocity, angle of projection, and gravity affect the trajectory of a projectile.
